# UNDERSTANDING DEVELOPER CONTRIBUTIONS IN OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE PROJECTS: AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS ACROSS NUGET, PYPI, AND NPM REPOSITORIES
This empirical study investigates the collaborative dynamics within open-source software (OSS) projects, particularly focusing on contributions in three prominent package repositories: NuGet, PyPI, and NPM, all hosted on GitHub. By analyzing usage patterns in these ecosystems, the research seeks to deepen our comprehension of developer participation in OSS projects, thereby contributing to their development and long-term sustainability.

The research delves into two key inquiries:

1. Examining the distribution of contributions across diverse categories such as code, documentation, and issue management.
2. Investigating the evolving patterns of developer contributions over time within NuGet, PyPI, and NPM repositories.

This analysis aims to empower project maintainers with insights into developers' roles, enabling tailored strategies for engagement, recognition, and motivation. For example, ecosystems with a prevalence of code contributions may benefit from structured code review processes, while those emphasizing documentation could prioritize acknowledging and incentivizing technical writers.

The methodology utilizes content analysis techniques to classify contributions based on commit messages, pull requests, and issue interactions. Time series analysis is employed to depict contribution trends over time, facilitating the identification of ongoing patterns and potential challenges.

The study's outcomes aspire to furnish actionable recommendations for nurturing expanding open-source communities, advocating for best practices, and enhancing the collaborative dynamics essential for advancing these ecosystems.
