# UNDERSTANDING DEVELOPER CONTRIBUTIONS IN OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE PROJECTS: AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS ACROSS NUGET, PYPI, AND NPM REPOSITORIES
Open source software (OSS) projects thrive on collaborative efforts from developers contributing code, documentation, issue triage, and knowledge. This empirical study focuses on the dynamics of contributions in three popular package repositories: NuGet, PyPI, and NPM, hosted on GitHub. The research aims to enhance our understanding of developer participation in OSS projects by examining usage patterns in these ecosystems, ultimately benefiting the development and long-term sustainability of these projects.

The research investigates two primary research questions:

1. The distribution of different types of contributions, such as code, documentation, and issue management.
2. The variation in developer contribution patterns over time in NuGet, PyPI, and NPM repositories.

By identifying specific types of contributions, project maintainers can gain insights into the various roles played by developers, allowing them to tailor their interaction, identification, and motivational strategies accordingly. For instance, ecosystems with a higher number of code-focused contributions may benefit from having specific code review processes, while those emphasizing documentation could prioritize appreciating writers.

The methodology employs content analysis techniques to categorize contributions into their respective types by analyzing commit messages, pull requests, and issue interactions. Time series are then used to create date-based representations of contribution times, helping identify ongoing trends or potential challenges.

The findings aim to provide valuable recommendations for supporting growing open-source communities, promoting best practices, and optimizing the collaborative interactions that drive these ecosystems forward.
