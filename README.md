UNDERSTANDING DEVELOPER CONTRIBUTIONS IN OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE PROJECTS: AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS ACROSS NUGET, PYPI, AND NPM REPOSITORIES
The query discusses an empirical study that explores the collaborative dynamics within open-source software (OSS) projects, focusing on contributions in three prominent package repositories: NuGet, PyPI, and NPM, all hosted on GitHub. The research aims to deepen understanding of developer participation in OSS projects, contributing to their development and long-term sustainability. The study examines two key aspects:

1. **Distribution of contributions**: The study analyzes the distribution of contributions across categories such as code, documentation, and issue management to provide insights into the roles of developers and inform strategies for engagement, recognition, and motivation.

2. **Evolving patterns of developer contributions**: The research investigates the evolving patterns of developer contributions over time within the NuGet, PyPI, and NPM repositories to identify ongoing trends and potential challenges.

The methodology involves content analysis to classify contributions based on commit messages, pull requests, and issue interactions, as well as time series analysis to depict contribution trends over time. The study's outcomes aim to provide actionable recommendations for nurturing expanding open-source communities, advocating for best practices, and enhancing collaborative dynamics essential for advancing these ecosystems.
