UNDERSTANDING DEVELOPER CONTRIBUTIONS IN OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE PROJECTS: AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS ACROSS NUGET, PYPI, AND NPM REPOSITORIES

This empirical study investigates collaborative dynamics within open-source software (OSS) projects, focusing on contributions in NuGet, PyPI, and NPM repositories hosted on GitHub. It aims to deepen our understanding of developer participation in OSS projects, enhancing their development and long-term sustainability.

The study delves into two main inquiries:

1. Distribution of contributions across categories like code, documentation, and issue management.
2. Evolving patterns of developer contributions over time within NuGet, PyPI, and NPM repositories.

The analysis seeks to empower project maintainers with insights into developers' roles, enabling tailored strategies for engagement, recognition, and motivation. For instance, ecosystems with a focus on code contributions may benefit from structured code review processes, while those emphasizing documentation could prioritize acknowledging and incentivizing technical writers.

Methodology involves content analysis techniques to classify contributions based on commit messages, pull requests, and issue interactions. Time series analysis is employed to depict contribution trends over time, aiding in identifying ongoing patterns and potential challenges.

The study's outcomes aim to provide actionable recommendations for nurturing open-source communities, advocating best practices, and enhancing collaborative dynamics critical for advancing these ecosystems.
